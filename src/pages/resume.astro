        <p>Hi! I am Carlos Saito,</p>
        <p>
          work as a developer at KTH (Royal Institute of Technology) in
          Stockholm;
        </p>
        <p>
          was hired initially as “Full-stack developer” and am pivoting recently
          to a more “UX engineer” role

              KTH has a new visual identity. The IT department and the web team
              was in charge of leading the digital side of the evolution.
            </p>
            <p>
              Design and prototype: co-organised design workshops with UX
              designers, copywriters and stakeholders and understand problems to
              solve, their needs and their opinions; prototyped and designed the
              first pieces of the new identity (the website header).
            </p>
            <p>
              Implementation: created a new version of the KTH Design System
              “KTH Style” and helped other teams to implement the new design
            </p>
            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The new version of KTH Style is no longer based on Bootstrap
              </li>
              <li>
                Create a library retro-compatible with the old version so teams
                can upgrade in small steps
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Design principles</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Modular: instead of importing the whole library (including parts
                outside of developers control), developers choose what parts to
                import
              </li>
              <li>
                Simple: the new version has less code and does not create unused
                abstractions
              </li>
              <li>Systematic: everything is defined as tokens (variables)</li>

              KTH website is unique in a sense that doesn’t have any “student
              portal”. Instead, what students, teachers and staff see when they
              log in is what is called the “Personal Menu”. The personal menu is
              a collection of shortcuts tailored for the user. If you are a
              student, you get links to your courses and your qualifications; if
              you are a teacher, you have access to course management tools.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve worked as a UX engineer in a cross-functional team composed
              by UX experts, developers and stakeholders. My starting point was
              a User Research and a concept, which I used to elaborate
              prototypes, conduct interviews with users and performing usability
              tests.
            </p>
            <p>
              We introduced TypeScript as a main language in the team and I
              helped developers transitioning from JavaScript to TypeScript
            </p>
            <p>
              What we delivered: a set of APIs that power-users have access, the
              menu itself; ideas and prototypes for future versions of the
              project.

              Teachers and students at KTH used a system called Canvas for their
              courses: teachers uploaded their course material and students
              submitted their homework. Canvas had an intern PDF editor tool
              that teachers could use to make annotations in students
              submissions so we had an idea: make a tool to import paper exams
              into Canvas so teachers could annotate and grade paper exams
              digitally.
            </p>
            <p>
              We’ve learned how the scanning process work at KTH; what are the
              people and systems involved in such process. We worked with other
              teams by communicating the failures in the process and the system.

              During the COVID-19 pandemic, KTH was forced to close its campus
              and become fully digital. We, e-learning, the responsible for the
              “digital learning environment” of the institution, became the
              central and most important team at KTH. We developed tools in
              record time to support digital teaching and examination, we
              adapted our workflows and schedules

              During these years I worked creating and maintaining systems that
              sync data from internal databases at KTH and a learning management
              system called Canvas. We also took the assignment to shut down an
              old database and move its content to a safe, GDPR-compliant
              system.
