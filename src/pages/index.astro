          <div>
            <p>
              Actually more happy than proud. If you want to find me somewhere

              But this site should also show what I care about. And what I do as
              a web developer when following my own principles
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Transparency</li>
              <li>Accessibility</li>
              <li>Sustainability</li>
              <li>Usability</li>

            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              Transparency: this page will not promise you anything that cannot
              do. That is easy since this is just a personal website
            </p>
            <p>
              Accessibility: every step in this process is thought with
              accessibility in mind. The colors, the shapes, the sizes, the HTML
              tags and attributes, the CSS, the JavaScript. And of course this
              site complies with WCAG (but that is a consequence of
              accessibility, not it’s cause)
            </p>
            <p>
              Sustainability: this page delivers the least possible amount of
              code to you, including HTML, CSS, JS, images and so on. The “big
              offenders” are compressed or removed
            </p>
            <p>
              Humanity: this page respects you, your time and your privacy. It
              does not show you any cookie banner because it does not store any
              tracking cookie in your browser
            </p>
            <p>
              Inclusion: I embrace my quirkiness. I am a geek, a nerd. I am cis
              man but don’t hide my feminine side. I accept my weakness, my
              kinkiness and don’t hide it
            </p>
            <p>
              Simplicity: the code is simple, easy to maintain, easy to look at.
              It does not add any incomprehensible abstraction

            sometimes I have short thoughts that I don’t know what to do with
            them
          </h2>
          <h3>Doing a “yearly accessibility report” is boring</h3>
          <p>
            It is boring when the process is filling a report to fill a
            checklist. It is not boring but a learning experience when we
            include accessibility the entire process (from design to
            development)
          </p>
          <h3>
            It is good to have principles but it is more important to understand
            what they mean
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Martin Fowler (?) coined the term “microservice” but he never said
              “they are awesome, more microservices the merrier”
            </li>
            <li>
              Knuth talked about “premature optimization” but never meant “you
              should not optimize” or “you should postpone optimizations”
            </li>
            <li>
              You should prioritize “code over documentation” according to the
              Agile Manifesto, but they never say “it’s ok to have bad
              documentation”
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>sometimes those thoughts are even shorter</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For this site, I’ve chosen the font families Ibarra Real Nova and
              Inter. The former is designed by a Spanish typographer; the latter
              by a Swedish one.
            </li>
            <li>
              We should use the right tool for the right problem, not trying to
              fit every problem in a single solution
            </li>
            <li>
              Sometimes our intuition says “hmm... nah... this thing looks an
              overkill...”. In those situations I tend to STOP, take a step back
              and rethink
            </li>

          These "notes" are things I find around and I think they are
          interesting somehow. If I have the time, I'll sort them out properly
