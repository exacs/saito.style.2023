I was born and grew up in Madrid, Spain, but my parents were japanese. I have a very common Spanish name (_Carlos_) and a very common Japanese surname (_Saito_) but a rather rare Spanish-Japanese combination --actually, not that rare, in Peru and LATAM it was more common than what I thought--.

Anyhow, one day, when I was 6 or 7 years old, a Japanese friend from my parents gave me a sticker for my GameBoy Color. A sticker from [Megaman](https://megaman.capcom.com/) (called Rockman in Japanese). The sticker was just a transformation of Megaman called ["Saito Style"](https://megaman.fandom.com/wiki/Hub_Style). I thought it was fun to have a sticker in my Gameboy that says "Saito Style".

And until today.

- When I was teen, everybody wanted to be different, so I started liking to be called Saito (my Spanish friends still call me that way)
- Then I started using "saito style" (with underscore, dash, without spaces, etc) as alias, nickname, handle in socials.
- Then I found that `.style` domains where available so I bought `saito.style` --just for fun--.
